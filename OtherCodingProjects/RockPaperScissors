# A program to play the game rock, paper & scissors

# This code was originally obtained from a Python tutorial

# Block 1 - Load the needed libraries
from random import randint

# Block 2 - Create a list of play options, Assign a Random Player to Computer
t = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
computer = t[randint(0,2)]

# Block 3 - Set Player to either True or False
# When Player = False
player = False
while player == False:

# When Player is True
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:

    # To allow loop to continue when false
